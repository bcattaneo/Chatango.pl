# Chatango.pl
A chatango client written in perl

Some time ago I "reverse engineered" chatango's protocol (https://www.chatango.com) for fun, in order to write a CLI client.
I kind of lost interest about it, but here's the working code for the connection (both private messaging and chatroom). It might be helpful for someone else.

Note: it works, but it's not yet finished, has plenty of comments for myself, needs cleaning, and so on
